# Data Generator for Real-Time Train Tracking System
## Project Overview
This repository contains a set of data generators designed to simulate GPS location data for trains in the Real-Time Train Tracking System. The generated data is used to test and demonstrate the functionality of the RESTful API and client applications developed as part of the overall system.

## Features
- Train Data Generator: Simulates the creation of train records with unique IDs, names, and initial locations.
- Route Data Generator: Generates data for train routes, including route IDs, names, and associated trains.
- Location Data Generator: Continuously generates and updates GPS location data for trains, mimicking real-time movements.
